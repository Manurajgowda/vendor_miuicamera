MiuiCamera from Xiaomi Mi A3
=========================================

This repository can be used to ship Xiaomi's MiuiCamera app ported from the Mi A3 (laurel_sprout) on custom ROMs. The APK has been manually patched to make all functions work perfectly on cepheus/davinci/raphael. Prebuilt `libcameraservice` has been imported from davinci's MIUI 20.10.30 CN to get 48MP and portrait mode working. Support for further devices can be added in future.
Use prebuilt camera provider for now.

## Currently supported devices:
* ~~Xiaomi Mi 9 (cepheus)~~
* Xiaomi Mi 9T (davinci, davinciin)
* ~~Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro  (raphael, raphaelin)~~
